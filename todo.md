The goal is to completely change the current game design
we want to make it super easy to play
make it an number + idle game instead of a half block/territory control game
We want to make everything to number based
Including building, army, combat
We probably still need several pages:
Buildings, Resources, Battle, Research
There will be no building unit idea ... feeling
all the buildings of the same type will be grouped together like resource
they make productions actions every 0.5s
there's no region concept, no expansion and map concept
The building slots will also be a type of resource
User need to build expander building to expand the buliding slots
However, the more expander player built, the more threat level it will be
We need some discussion on the battle mechanism
Let's probably build a base building
Every x seconds/minutes (depending on the threat level)
there will be enemy threats
enemy threat will have two consequences
attack + life
player need to have enough defend bulidings/units, or repair speed, or large base health
to endure the attack
and player need to have enough attack power to defeat the enemies
Therefore, all resources, power, minerals, buildings are all shared in the same space.
In this case we cannot control the individual level of the buildings
hence, we need to have a new concpet as -- unique-function buildings
which means, once these buildings are built, they must be operating
and they only have one function
Hence, In the building tab, a assembler/furnace, that's previously used to choose receipes,
now it will show multiple different buildings, called assembler-circuit
furnace-iron-plate. etc.
In this case, each resource will have their own storage.
Probably this could better be done in the resource tab.
Each resource can attach with one button -- increase storage (that will cause slots)
BTW I don't like the name slots -- needs to be something like space/lands...etc.
In this case, I want to idle game feeling, where user just click and build more
buildings, and resource are increasing heavily.
A more fundamental change that can make game logic easy is
to make the energy also a resource unit. the power plants could provide some basic energy storage, but not much.

科研tab也要跟建筑tab一样
有一个infobox，当点击一个科研box的时候，infobox里显示科研的介绍，需要的资源，前置，后置科技，还有研究button
下面的科研也都变成一个一个box，可以显示科研级别（红包1级， 绿包2级。。以次类推）。一个科研可能需要多种科研包，按照等级最大的科研包决定科研的等级。
不要研究进度了，点击直接解锁。
科研中心也不负责产生科研进度，直接作为科研包的生产工厂。
