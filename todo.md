the mouse wheel doesn't work now
when start a new game, need to ask user to select a slot
When save game, just select a slot, don't pop up input box
first tab, 区域信息, need further compact done. Don't need to show the region name, don't need to show the available slots
Let's make all buildings take 1 slot, and 10 slots per region as default
建筑概况 is werid and conflict with 建筑列表
建造 tab, the top box is too big, make it very compact and two small boxes
Let's make the first region has no coal. player needs to goto region 2 to get coal and related techs
So the fire power plant should be a technology that unlocks after block 2
The military tab is also too loose, need more more compact.
And at the beginning, there should be no troops or ammos at all.
There should be related tech to unlock the receipe of the basic drones...etc
and basic ammo
also, if a drone/ammo is not unlock from tech, then don't show it
In the top of military, tab, show the current battle power
The upperbound of ammo can be decided by the storage
But the upperbound of the drones are determined by control tower (+20 per building, unlocked together wit hthe first drone tech -- basic millitary)
make the map tab also compact compact, in grid. I don't like the name of the regions...so plain. Either make them exotic, or just put a number like 区域1/区域2
I'm also changing my mind of hiding the regions. Maybe show all the regions (but in unavailable state) until the next boss region is occupied.
For each region box, show it's number (and name), available resources, and potential enemies. user click the button of the region to see more details.
For tech tab, make it more compact (e.g. 4 boxes one row)
